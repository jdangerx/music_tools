# Music Tools

Small tools I use to augment my learning.

### Random naturals

#### Motivation:
I want to learn the locations of all the natural notes on the fretboard. I've gotten pretty good at going up and down each string in a scale, but I'd like to stop counting up and down from the landmarks on the fretboard.

#### Usage:
``` bash
$ ./random_naturals.py <tempo>
```

Then play each note it asks of you. `tempo` defaults to 60.
